## About the project
We present a practical demonstration of Tuplex, a Python-based system designed to handle exceptions encountered during data cleaning tasks. 
Tuplex separates exceptions from normal data processing, allowing users to define custom functions to handle exceptional cases with flexibility and efficiency. 
Through a complete data science project demonstration, we will show the capabilities of Tuplex in data cleaning processes and enhancing overall workflow efficiency.

## How to run
The package set up is based on google colab environment, so it's recommend to run in colab.
